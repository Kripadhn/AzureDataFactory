Snowflake schema model: The Snowflake schema model is an extension of the star schema model, where the dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables. In ADF, the Snowflake schema model can be implemented by creating a pipeline to extract data from various sources, transform it, and load it into multiple related dimension tables in Azure Synapse Analytics or Azure SQL Database.
