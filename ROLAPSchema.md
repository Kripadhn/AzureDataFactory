Relational OLAP (ROLAP) model: The ROLAP model is a relational data warehousing model where data is organized into a star schema or snowflake schema and stored in a relational database. In ADF, the ROLAP model can be implemented by creating a pipeline to extract data from various sources, transform it, and load it into a relational database in Azure Synapse Analytics or Azure SQL Database.
